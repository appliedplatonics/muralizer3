Muralizer III: third time's a charm

Muralizer is a simple drawbot.  You can use it to go from a vector
image file (SVG, etc) to lines on a whiteboard or wall, using standard
markers or paint pens.

It uses two spools of wire to drag a pen across a board.  This version
also includes a "pen lift" command, which allows non-contiguous lines,
or for other actuation at the write head (eg paint cans could
theoretically be used).



Getting started
---------------

This is currently an unsupported/alpha release.  It's not clear that
Applied Platonics will ever actually ship kits for this, but it seemed
to be a shame to not actually share the creation.

With that in mind: there is no real support for this release, and its
documentation may be a bit lacking.  Apologies in advance, though
hopefully a quick skim through it will be helpful if you're
considering building a drawbot of your own.



Contents
--------

The design is in three parts:

circuits/ -- The circuit boards and schematics, in Eagle CAD format
firmware/ -- the firmware for the circuit boards
inkscape_extension/ -- the Inkscape "driver" for the board

The Inkscape extension is a heavily-modified version of the eggbot
driver, part of the EggBot from EMSL.  Earlier versions of muralizer
used standalone ruby and python programs; integrating into Inkscape
was always a TODO item.  This was a fairly easy way to get there,
though a lot of stuff was modified beyond recognition in the process.

Evil Mad Science Laboratories and their original eggbot driver.  It
was a very helpful shortcut to getting into the Inkscape ecosystem.
